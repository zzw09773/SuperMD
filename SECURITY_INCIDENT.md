# üö® Security Incident Report

## Incident Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Issue**: Google Cloud Service Account credentials were accidentally committed to Git repository
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## What Happened

The file `SuperMD/server/google-credentials.json` containing sensitive Google Cloud Service Account credentials was committed to the Git repository and pushed to GitHub.

GitHub's Secret Scanning feature detected the credentials and blocked the push with error:
```
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found for refs/heads/main
remote: - Push cannot contain secrets
remote: ‚Äî Google Cloud Service Account Credentials ‚Äî
```

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. ‚úÖ Removed Credentials from Git
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` to prevent future leaks
- Removed `google-credentials.json` from Git tracking
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove credentials from entire Git history
- Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub

### 2. ‚úÖ Created Safe Alternatives
- Created `google-credentials.json.example` as template
- Added `CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md` with setup instructions
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude all credential files

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Required: Revoke Compromised Credentials

**IMPORTANT**: The exposed credentials MUST be revoked immediately.

#### Steps to Revoke:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**:
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Navigate to project that was exposed

2. **Revoke Service Account Key**:
   - Go to **IAM & Admin** ‚Üí **Service Accounts**
   - Find the service account used in the exposed credentials
   - Go to **Keys** tab
   - **Delete** the compromised key
   - The key ID from the exposed file: `[CHECK YOUR EXPOSED FILE]`

3. **Create New Service Account** (Recommended):
   - Create a new service account with different name
   - Generate new JSON key
   - Update your local `google-credentials.json`
   - DO NOT commit this file (it's in `.gitignore` now)

4. **Verify Old Key is Revoked**:
   - Test that old credentials no longer work
   - Confirm new credentials work properly

## Prevention Measures

### Implemented ‚úÖ

1. **Comprehensive `.gitignore`**:
   - Excludes all credential files
   - Excludes environment files
   - Excludes sensitive configuration

2. **Example Templates**:
   - `google-credentials.json.example` for reference
   - Clear setup documentation

3. **Security Documentation**:
   - `CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md` with best practices
   - Warnings about credential security

### Recommended üîß

1. **Use Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # .env (also in .gitignore)
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=...
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY=...
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_CLIENT_EMAIL=...
   ```

2. **Use Secret Management**:
   - GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
   - AWS Secrets Manager / Google Secret Manager for production
   - HashiCorp Vault for enterprise

3. **Pre-commit Hooks**:
   - Install git-secrets or similar tools
   - Scan commits before they're made
   - Prevent credential leaks automatically

## Checklist

- [x] Remove credentials from Git tracking
- [x] Clean Git history (filter-branch)
- [x] Add .gitignore for future protection
- [x] Create example template file
- [x] Document setup process
- [ ] **REVOKE COMPROMISED CREDENTIALS** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] **CREATE NEW SERVICE ACCOUNT KEY** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] Verify new credentials work
- [ ] Delete old credentials file from local machine (if desired)

---

## Impact Assessment

**Exposure Duration**: From first commit to detection (hours/days)
**Exposure Scope**: Public GitHub repository
**Potential Access**: Anyone who:
- Cloned the repository during exposure
- Accessed GitHub's cache/index
- Used git history tools

**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH (until credentials are revoked)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always add .gitignore FIRST** before committing any code
2. **Never commit credentials** - use environment variables or secret managers
3. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning** (already active, saved us!)
4. **Use pre-commit hooks** to prevent leaks
5. **Regular security audits** of repository contents
